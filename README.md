# WhatsItLikeOutside
Weather application made in Java with a nice little graphic. Made in early 2021.
I used the OpenWeatherMap API to make a Weather application to show the time, temperature
and weather of the area that you have specified. There is a graphic of the Sun or Moon
which I used trigonometry to make move in a semicircle over the screen. (So if it's
midday, the Sun will be in the middle of this semicircle path). You can also change
the location of where you're looking at the weather for using longitude and latitude.

This project gave me an insight into using APIs for development and working with the
data that they give. It also helped my Java graphics skills. The API key in this repository
has since been deactivated and will no longer work.
